Dapper Resource: ActiveResource Instance Authentication
=======================================================

Dapper Resource rewires ActiveResource so that you can pass find methods arbitrary
connection objects, and add arbitrary connection objects to ARes model instances,
which will then be used in save operations.

Dapper Resource adds new functionality to ARes but leaves the original system in
place. Its primary use case is Web services using Basic HTTP Authentication on a
user-by-user basis, where each user of the Rails app maps directly to a user in the
Web service's authentication system. In a situation like that, you can't get much
done with class-level specification of username and password; Dapper Resource to
the rescue.

For detailed examples of usage, check out the spec directory.
